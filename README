Link to Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/438/health+news+in+twitter
Libraries Used: pathlib, typing, re, random, math, collections (none of these have versions)

Assumptions:
  1. Python 3.9.6 installed
  2. IDE installed (VS Code is recommended)
  3. Pip 23.0.1 installed

To Run Code
  1. Navigate to file in IDE after downloading
  2. Install the necessary libraries
  3. Make sure you are in the right directory. Change directory by typing cd then the directory name 
  4. Go to https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/438/health+news+in+twitter
  5. Press download and unzip the folder. Then move the folder into your current directory as the code
  6. Select desired dataset and copy the path. Put this path in "FILE_PATH" variable above main.
  7. You can change the K values as well and number of iterations in the hyperparameters.
  8. Type python3 part2.py to run code
